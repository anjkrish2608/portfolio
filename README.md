This project is a responsive website which consists of three separate webpages. Throughout the creation of this website bootstrap css was used to create the navbar, grid layout, image responsiveness, cards and sticky footer. Finally the html was validated. The website displays a layout for a website which will be later filled with true content as I create and establish my own portfolio. 

Throughout forming this website I faced many challenges. Firstly the challenge of the grid system on index.html, I struggled to create the sub-columns under the 'About Me' section - this was finally resolved due to poor row planning. This same issue later occured on portfolio.html when inputting the cards however this time it was easy to spot the issue and resolve it. Another issue I faced was the button function on the navbar however, thanks to Aman, this was easily resolved by linking to javascript and jQuery at the bottom of the body tag. 

Throughout numerous testings the design in total is fairly mobile responsive, this is most definitely a key area of improvement for the website however I am happy with the progress made so far. The text size was set to view port which I am confident about.


## Credits
Throughout the creation of this website the bootstrap documentation was heaviliy consulted. It was used to create the grid layout, the navbar, sticky footer and the cards. 
The suggested html was copied and changed in order to be responsive to media queries and viewport. Bootstrap was also used to make the images media responsive. 
The html was validated through **https://www.freeformatter.com/html-validator.html**.
